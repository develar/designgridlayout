		DesignGridLayout is a revolutionary and innovative Swing LayoutManager inspired by 
		the use of canonical grids for user interface design. Its goal is to 
		be useful for typical form-based designs.  DesignGridLayout is an alternative to 
		other grid-based layout managers

		<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/tablelayout/">TableLayout</a> and
		<a href="http://www.miglayout.com/">MiGLayout</a>).
		DesignGridLayout works with JDK 1.5 and later.

		<p>
		The idea of user interfaces based on canonical grids is described in the book 
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133033899">Designing Visual Interfaces: Communication Oriented Techniques</a> 
		by Kevin Mullet and Darrell Sano.  Available online, Patrizia Nanni's thesis 
		<a href="http://www.vhml.org/theses/nannip/HCI_final.htm">Human-Computer Interaction: Principles of Interface Design</a> 
		has a nice chapter called 
		<a href="http://www.vhml.org/theses/nannip/HCI_final.htm#_Toc87596295">Module and Program: Grid-based Design</a>, 
		which also references Mullet and Sano's work.

		<h3> What makes DesignGridLayout revolutionary and innovative? </h3>
		<p>
		DesignGridLayout's primary innovation is a well behaved simple layout algorithm 
		exposed as a convenient API. Just add rows from top to bottom and components 
		from left to right.
		</p>
		<p>
		But more than that, DesignGridLayout is <b>smart</b>:
		<ul>
			<li>it manages all margins, gaps, alignments (baseline and vertical) automagically 
				for you, while respecting UI guidelines for the current platform 
				(as defined by the Look and Feel)</li>
			<li>it makes sure your UI is always visually pleasing (that's the 
				power of canoncial grids)</li>
			<li>it knows how to count: you never need to specify upfront how many 
				columns or rows you have in your UI, DesignGridLayout will automatically 
				count that for you! This way, you generally don't need to mock up your UI 
				on paper first and try to draw virtual grid lines like most grid-oriented 
				LayoutManagers impose</li>
			<li>it does not require you to specify which rows should be able to vertically 
				grow during user resize and which rows should have fixed height: 
				DesignGridLayout automatically detect both types of rows!</li>
			<li>DesignGridLayout will also make sure that the height of special components 
				-such as a <code>JList</code>- is always appropriate for the content, i.e. allows to 
				display all rows in their full height (not truncated like all other 
				LayoutManagers)</li>
			<li>thanks to its fluent API, DesignGridLayout makes it a breeze to define 
				your UI forms; it also makes the learning curve very short: you can be 
				fully effective in less than one hour!</li>
		</ul>

 		<p>
 		<blockquote>Very impressive, and you nailed it!<br>-- Darrell Sano, March 21st, 2006</blockquote>
 		</p>
		<h3> Quick Start </h3>
		<p>
		Try it now using WebStart:
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">
			<a href="examples.jnlp"><img class="aligncenter" src="webstart.png" border="0" alt="" width="88" height="23" /></a>
		</p>
		<p>
		Try it offline: Download 
		<a href="https://designgridlayout.dev.java.net/files/documents/4350/122552/designgridlayout-1.1-rc4.jar">designgridlayout-1.1-rc4.jar</a>,
		<a href="https://designgridlayout.dev.java.net/files/documents/4350/122554/designgridlayout-1.1-rc4-tests.jar">designgridlayout-1.1-rc4-tests.jar</a>
		and <a href="https://designgridlayout.dev.java.net/files/documents/4350/122557/swing-layout-1.0.2.jar">swing-layout-1.0.2.jar</a>. 
		Add them to your classpath. Launch the examples with 
		<code>java&nbsp;net.java.dev.designgridlayout.showdown.Examples</code>.  
 		</p>
 		<p>
 		The DesignGridLayout Examples application is the best way to get started with DesignGridLayout: 
 		it guides you step by step through every DesignGridLayout feature and always shows the
 		relevant source code to produce each demonstrated layout.
 		</p>
		<p>
		Although the Examples application is a good quick start to DesignGridLayout, it is advised
		to read the following additional documentation, found on the project web site (particularly the 
		2 first links below):
		<ul>
			<li><a href="nonav/site/index.html">Introduction</a> is a quick introduction to
				DesignGridLayout in terms of motivation, philosophy, features and roadmap</li>
			<li><a href="nonav/site/grids.html">Canonical Grids</a> is a quick introduction to
				canonical grids used by DesignGridLayout</li>
			<li><a href="nonav/site/usage.html">Usage</a> demonstrates DesignGridLayout
				API usage through simple examples</li>
			<li><a href="nonav/site/examples.html">Examples</a> shows more concrete,
				real life examples where DesignGridLayout is used, along with the
				source code</li>
			<li><a href="nonav/site/apidocs/index.html">Javadoc</a> is the reference
				documentation of DesignGridLayout API</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		With the Examples application and the documentation above, you can start using 
		DesignGridLayout on your own and create professional Swing UI dialogs only <b>one hour</b> 
		after starting, and this with only a few lines of code!

		<h3> Acknowledgements </h3>
		<p> DesignGridLayout relies on the component baseline functionality from the 
		<a href="https://swing-layout.dev.java.net/">Swing Layout project</a>.  The baseline 
		work is non-trivial and an important contribution to user interface development.  DesignGridLayout authors are 
		grateful for the efforts of <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/zixle/">Scott Violet</a> and all other contributors.  </p>
		<p> Karsten Lentzsch, of <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com">JGoodies</a> fame, has probably 
		been the most influential contributor towards making professional, high quality user
		interfaces in Swing.  He was definitely one of the first.  His efforts have been a source of inspiration.
