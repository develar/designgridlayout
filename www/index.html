		DesignGridLayout is a LayoutManager inspired by the use of canonical grids for user interface design. Its goal is to 
		be useful for typical form-based designs.  DesignGridLayout is an alternative to other grid-based layout managers

		<a href="http://www.autel.cz/dmi/tutorial.html">HIGLayout</a>, 
		<a href="http://pnuts.org/snapshot/latest/modules/pnuts.awt/doc/PnutsLayout.html">PnutsLayout</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.datadosen.se/riverlayout/">RiverLayout</a>,
		<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip129.html">SGLayout</a>, and
		<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/tablelayout/">TableLayout</a>).  DesignGridLayout works with JDK 1.5
		and later.

		<p>
		The idea of user interfaces based on canonical grids is 
	    described in the book 
		<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133033899">Designing Visual Interfaces: Communication Oriented Techniques</a> 
		by Kevin Mullet and Darrell Sano.  Available online, Patrizia Nanni's thesis <a href="http://www.vhml.org/theses/nannip/HCI_final.htm">
		Human-Computer Interaction: Principles of Interface Design</a> has a nice chapter called 
		<a href="http://www.vhml.org/theses/nannip/HCI_final.htm#_Toc87596295">Module and Program: Grid-based Design</a>, which also
		references Mullet and Sano's work.
 		</p>
		<p>
		DesignGridLayout's primary 
		innovation is a well behaved simple layout algorithm exposed as a convenient API.  No need to specify constraints.  Just
		add rows from top to bottom and components from left to right.  Sizing, resizing, aligning component baselines, margins,
		and gutters are all handled automatically.

		<h3> Acknowledgements </h3>
		<p> DesignGridLayout relies on the component baseline functionality from the 
		<a href="https://swing-layout.dev.java.net/">Swing Layout project</a>.  The baseline 
		work is non-trivial and an important contribution to user interface development.  DesignGridLayout authors are 
		grateful for the efforts of <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/zixle/">Scott Violet</a> and all other contributors.  </p>
		<p> Karsten Lentzsch, of <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com">JGoodies</a> fame, has probably 
		been the most influential contributor towards making professional, high quality user
		interfaces in Swing.  He was definitely one of the first.  His efforts have been a source of inspiration.
