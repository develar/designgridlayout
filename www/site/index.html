Labels in these columns are aligned according to platform guidelines or can be forced left or right</li><li>Support for high components (e.g. <tt>JList</tt>) <b>spanning several grid rows</b></li><li><b>Smart horizontal resize</b> that preserves the UI balance (by enlarging all components consistently)</li><li><b>Smart vertical resize</b>: DesignGridLayout automatically detects rows that should grow in height during vertical resize (based on the components they contain); after resize, <tt>JTable</tt>, <tt>JList</tt>, <tt>JTextArea</tt> components never contain truncated items (row or text line)</li><li>Automatic support for <b>right-to-left languages</b></li><li>Total <b>resolution independence</b>: no need for any hard-coded position or spacing</li></ul></div>
