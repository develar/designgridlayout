	John O'Conner started the {{{http://weblogs.java.net/blog/joconner/archive/2006/10/layout_manager.html}Layout Manager Showdown}},
	pitting everyone's favorite layout manager against all challengers in 
	no-holds-barred cage fight. Here's the entry for DesignGridLayout:

	While creating DesignGridLayout, the original author used figures 177, 178 
	and 179 from "Designing Visual Interfaces" to help validate and work through 
	his ideas. He found scans of the original figures 
	{{{http://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/422/week11.html}in this online syllabus}}
	(scroll down to the bottom).  Here are the screenshots from matching those 
	figures while using DesignGridLayout.
