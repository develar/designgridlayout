Canonical grids

	The idea of user interfaces based on canonical grids is described in the book 
	{{{http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0133033899}Designing Visual Interfaces: Communication Oriented Techniques}} 
	by Kevin Mullet and Darrell Sano. Available online, Patrizia Nanni's thesis 
	{{{http://www.vhml.org/theses/nannip/HCI_final.htm}Human-Computer Interaction: Principles of Interface Design}}
	has a nice chapter called 
	{{{http://www.vhml.org/theses/nannip/HCI_final.htm#_Toc87596295}Module and Program: Grid-based Design}}, 
	which also references Mullet and Sano's work.

	Canonical grids are visual tools used by graphic artists to design magazines, 
	posters, advertisements, forms, and so forth. As an artist friend told the 
	original author of DesignGridLayout, the use of grids is "graphic design 101, 
	taught on the first day".
	
	Here are the steps to create a simple 4 column canonical grid. First, divide 
	the rectangle horizontally into halves (1/2). The light gray represents the 
	gaps (for gutters and margins) between columns.

	Then add divisions for thirds (1/3).

	Lastly, add divisions for fourths (1/4).

	Voila! The black lines represent the 4 column canonical grid.

	For each row, the row is divided by the number of components you add. Adding 
	two components divides the grid in half. Adding three components divides 
	the grid in thirds.

	So here's an example.

	See how everything lines up nicely? There's two interesting cases to note.  

	*	Row 3 has just two components, but the row is divided in thirds. That's 
		because the first component spans 2 columns, so the total number of 
		components is considered to be 3.

	*	Row 4 has no component in the fourth column. Rows having empty columns 
		is common for forms.
