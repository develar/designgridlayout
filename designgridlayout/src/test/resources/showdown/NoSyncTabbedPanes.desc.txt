This real-life example will show how DesignGridLayout Synhcronization feature makes sure that transtion from one tab to another, in a JTabbedPane, is always smooth without visual hops that are often disturbing for the end-users.

First, the example shows a JTabbedPane with 2 tabs and various components in each, WITHOUT synchronization.

If you launch the example and alternate from one tab to another, you will clearly see some horizontal and vertical hops: for instance, the first rows of each tab are not baseline-aligned; similarly the first text field of the first tab is not at the same X origin as the combo box in the second tab. Note that this baselines misalignment sometimes doesn't exist, based on the current look & feel. If you want to be sure to observe it, then you should use Metal look & feel.

The next example will show the same panel with synchronization.

Source code is standard DesignGridLayout stuff and just shows how each panel was built.  Note the empty postBuild() method that will be overridden in the next example to show synchronization.
