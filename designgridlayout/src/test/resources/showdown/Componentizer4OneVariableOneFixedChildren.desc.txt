This second example shows a common use case of Componentizer, to create a component made of JTextField of variable width and a fixed-width JButton, used e.g. to select a file from the file system.

The horizontal resize behavior of the new component is as follows:
- its preferred width is based upon the sum of both components preferred widths
- its minimum width is the same as its preferred width
- when it's given a width bigger than its preferred width, then the JTextField gets all extra width, while the JButton keeps its preferred width

Although, for the sake of code reuse, this example (as well as all other Componentizer examples) uses Componentizer.Builder, the more common way to use Componentizer to get the same result is:

JComponent component = Componentizer.create().prefAndMore(field("Select a file for upload")).fixedPref(button("Select..."));
