This example is based on the previous layout example but demonstrates the use of custom vertical weight growth factors.

DesignGridLayout can automatically detect which rows are candidates to grow when the dialog is vertically resized. When it comes to rows containing the same spanning component, DesignGridLayout assigns a growth factor of 1.0 to the last spanned row, all rows above get a weight of 0.0 (i.e. they will be fixed in height).

Although you cannot change fixed height rows (with a weight of 0.0), you can modify the weight of the last spanned row (with any value >= 0.0). This is illustrated in this example, where the first list never grows.

The source code slightly defers from the previous example by the argument added to the call to the row() method.
