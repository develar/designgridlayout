This third example explains the special case of labels used in grid rows. It is based on the previous example, but it simply sets a label for each grid row.

The peculiarity of labels in grid rows is that they define a specific "label column" which does not obey the rules of canonical grids, ie its width is always constant whatever the total available width of the dialog.
Moreover, such labels are not added by the usual "add()" method but directly in the "grid()" method that starts a grid row.
As you can guess, passing no label to "grid()" means there is no label for the current grid row. In this situation, if no row has a label then the "label column" is actually empty (width = 0), otherwise rows without a label will have an empty space in the "label column".
