This example shows a simple use of Componentizer to create a new component from another one; the new component keeps a fixed width (the preferred width of the other component) whatever the size of its container.

This is particularly useful with a LayoutManager like DesignGridLayout that normally use the whole available width for components inside a grid column. Although canonical grids are a powerful way to get beautifully balanced layouts, there may be some situations where you want a component in a grid, limited to its preferred width, a JSpinner for instance.

Although, for the sake of code reuse, this example (as well as all other Componentizer examples) uses Componentizer.Builder, the more common way to use Componentizer to get the same result is:

JComponent component = Componentizer.create().fixedPref(field("999-999-999-999-999-999")).component();
