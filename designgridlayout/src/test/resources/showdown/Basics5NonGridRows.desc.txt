This example shows further examples of non grid rows (rows that don't obey the "canonical grids" rules).
The example shows the three kinds of rows (left-aligned, centered, right-aligned), along with the special "fill" feature for such rows that allows extremity components to take all remaining available space in the row.
Using this feature is particular useful for using "group separators" as seen in the first row of this example.

Source code shows the use of "fill()" to get this specific behavior; calling fill() means that the "extreme" component(s) of the row will span to the edge of the container. The meaning of "extreme" depends on the kind of row:
- left-aligned: the rightmost component expands to the right
- right-aligned: the leftmost component expands to the left
- centered: the 2 outermost components expand to the left and right respectively
