This section shows how you can change alignment of labels used in DesignGridLayout grids.

By default, DesignGridLayout forces label alignment according to UI guidelines for the current platform, e.g. right-alignment on Macintosh, left-alignment on Windows...

You can, if you want, fix the label alignment to something else than the platform default, as shown in the following examples, all derived from the previous "Example - Address Book Demo", which label-alignment is forced to right whatever the platform.

Note that if you called labelAlignment(...) several times on a given layout, only the last setting is effective and used for the whole layout content.
