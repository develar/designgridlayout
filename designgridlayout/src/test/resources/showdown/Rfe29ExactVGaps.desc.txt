This example (and the next one) shows how DesignGridLayout computes vertical gaps between consecutive rows.

By default, DesignGridLayout calculates the exact vertical gap between every pair of consecutive rows in the layout. Hence this vertical gap may vary from one pair of rows to another.

Despite this variation, you can observe that the UI still seems well balanced in terms of real estate occupation; that's the reason why this behavior is the default.

The source code doesn't show anything special here.
