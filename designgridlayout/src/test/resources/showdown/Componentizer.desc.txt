This section demonstrates Componentizer, a special utility that horizontally assembles several components into one new component.

You can define the horizontal resize behavior of individual components when the embedding component gets resized.

This can be particularly useful with DesignGridLayout when, for instance, you don't want a component to be resized to use the full width of a column, or when you want 2 components in the same grid column.

Componentizer can also be useful when used with other LayoutManager in various occasions.
