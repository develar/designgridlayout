In addition to left, center and right non-grid rows, DesignGridLayout also has another kind of row that doesn't obey the "canonical grids" rules. The "command bar" row is specially used for a row with standard buttons (such as "OK", "Cancel", "Help", "Apply"...) which position on the row varies across platforms due to different UI guidelines.

When using a command bar row, you have to tag each added button to determine its type, then DesignGridLayout will automatically determine the position for each added button, based on the current platform.

In a command row, you can also add non standard components, either left-aligned, right-aligned or center-located inside the row, based on the method called to add these components.

In "command bar" rows, all components have exactly the same width (the maximum of preferred widths of all components in the row).

Source code shows how easy it is to add command rows to a layout, how you tag components (by using the Tag enum) and how you can also add non-standard components on the left and right sides of the row.
In this example, the first command bar illustrates how you would use this feature for a wizard dialog; the second command bar shows a simple use (only "OK" and "Cancel" standard buttons) with additional specific buttons.
