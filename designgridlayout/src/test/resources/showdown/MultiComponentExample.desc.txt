This example shows how to avoid that some components in a grid row get resized when the whole form is resized.
Please note that normally you would not want to do that, because this could break the visual balance of the whole form.
This is achieved by defining "multi components" (1 or more components) that will have a fixed size (their preferred size).

In the example, the first row is a grid row with 2 columns, the first of which is a multi-component (made of 2 fields). The second row is a centered row with 2 cells, the first of which is also a multi-component made of 2 fields.
Note the behavior when horizontally resizing the form.

The source code shows the use of "addMulti()" method (instead of "add()").
