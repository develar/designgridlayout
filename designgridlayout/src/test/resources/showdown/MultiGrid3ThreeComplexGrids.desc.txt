This is a very complex sample showing multiple grids. Although it is not lkely that all your dialogs have this look, some of your most complex dialogs may have though.
This sample creates 3 grids and several rows; inside rows, all grids themselves have various numbers of components; once again, for some rows, some grids span several grids of the global layout.

Although the dialog is very complex, the source code itself is no more complex than need be (ie as complex as the layout itself but no more).
