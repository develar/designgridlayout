This is an example with various components and rows of all types.
This example appears there in normal left-to-right orientation for reference.

The source code shows 2 classes, one abstract class (that is also used in the next example) and the concrete class used for the example.
The relevant bits are the way the example "forces" the text orientation to left-to-right". This is useful for the purpose of the example, but in a real application, text orientation of components is automatically set based on the current Locale used by the application.
