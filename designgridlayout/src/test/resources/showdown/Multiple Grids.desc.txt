This section illustrates the capacity of DesignGridLayout to define several vertical groups of components in a form.

Each group defines a "grid" (sometimes also called "sub-grid" because it is part of a "grid row") that is canonical and has an optional column for labels.

At the row level, it is possible to define components that span several grids of the layout. When several grids are spanned this way in a row, they act as a single canonical grid (with the visual balance as normal canonical grids).

This feature makes it easy to define complex forms with a lot of information in a limited space (without this feature, if you definitly need a form with a lot of fields, then you end up with a very high but narrow form).
