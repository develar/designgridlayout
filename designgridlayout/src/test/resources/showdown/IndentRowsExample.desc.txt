This example demonstrates usage of DesignGridLayout 1.8 new indent() API. This API allows to indent rows so that they appear as "children" of the previous -non indented- row.

This can be particularly useful when you want to show different "sections" in a panel, separated with a label and a horizontal ruler. Then you would indent all rows under a given section, i.e. below such a separator row.

It is possible to indent a row of several levels if needed, although it such a layout would generally not look right.

The source code shows the use of "indent()" with several indentation levels, on different kinds of rows. Note that, as expected, indent() has no effect on a right-aligned row; for centered rows, the indentation space looks half the size for other rows, because in this case, components are centered in a row which width has been substracted the full indent size.
