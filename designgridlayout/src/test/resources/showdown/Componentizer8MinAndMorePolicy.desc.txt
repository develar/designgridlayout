This example is similar to the previous one, but it uses a different resize policy for the JTextField.

In this example, the JTextField has a width that can vary from its minimum width (not its preferred width like in previous example) upwards.

Also, this example uses the more general add(WidthPolicy, JComponent...) API.

Although, for the sake of code reuse, this example (as well as all other Componentizer examples) uses Componentizer.Builder, the more common way to use Componentizer to get the same result is:

JComponent component = Componentizer.create().add(WidthPolicy.MIN_AND_MORE, field("Select a file for upload")).add(WidthPolicy.PREF_FIXED, button("Select..."));

This example could also be rewritten by using the more specific API:

JComponent component = Componentizer.create().minAndMore(field("Select a file for upload"))
	.fixedPref(button("Select...")).component();
