This is a more realistic example of a dialog showing a picture spanning 3 rows.

What is particularly interesting in that example is how the "Picture" class has been implemented so that DesignGridLayout "smart vertical resize" can work on it.
The idea is to have Picture implement Scrollable and put its instance into a JScrollPane. However, the 2 following points are worth noticing:

1. In Picture, the implementation of Scrollable methods getScrollableTracksViewportHeight() and getScrollableTracksViewportWidth() return true so that the dimension of the Picture component will always be adjusted to the dimension of the JScrollPane.

2. The JScrollPane instance is setup so that it never shows any scrollbar (because of point 1. above).
